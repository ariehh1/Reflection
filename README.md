# Reflection

<h1>The Journey so far:</h1>

<u>What have I learned so far?</u>

What have I accomplished?

Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

From the very first week of class

<h1>Path to Success:</h1>

Goals for the remainder of the course?

What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?

What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?

What do you plan to do to ensure you accomplish these goals?

How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?
