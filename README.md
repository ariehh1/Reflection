# Reflection

<h1>The Journey so far:</h1>

What have I learned so far?

I've learned first and foremost that the web development industry is constantly evolving. The techniques, syntax, and best practices of the coding languagues I've been introduced to will be outdated at some point. I've learned within this Bootcamp to soak in all of the information and continue practicing, fine-tuning, and refining my techniques. In order to grow and establish myself within this industry, I have to continue learning and applying myself. The more repetition and practice will only benefit me in the long term.

What have I accomplished?

Since November, I have now learned several different coding languages that make up the full stack. As we continue learning more front and back end languages, I will continue building functional applications for everyday use. Looking back on each homework assignment, I'm very proud of the work and effort I've put forth to make those applications come to life. I'm also looking forward to sharing my collaborative project application with future employers and explaining the architecture of Pocket-Bartender.

Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

From the very first week of class, I had an extremely open mind about what to expect during the course. I knew I would be intellectually challenged in a way I've never been before. I knew it was going to take some time for me to integrate back into the "school" mode and getting used to a regular routine. I was certainly feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and nervous to get underway but my confidence level has grown since that first week. I'm more confident in my abilities because I've learned throughout this course to engage with your resources as much as possible. I'm comfortable asking the instructional staff questions and know where to look online if I get stuck on a code roadblock.

<h1>Path to Success:</h1>

Goals for the remainder of the course?

In the second half of the Bootcamp, I want to push myself towards completing the pre-class drills and homework bonuses. If I get stuck anywhere in the process, I will start pseudocoding out the steps and ask if I'm on the right path. In-between class sessions, I will write down what questions I have from the previous lectures and review them with the instructional staff to see where the roadblocks are occurring.

What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?

I hope that I can schedule an informational interview with a web developer or engineer to get a sense of what an actual job is like in the industry. This will help me when I go apply for a specific position because I'll know immediately if I could make an impact within that role. If I see a job description that looks to be a good fit for me, I will call and email the recruiter to understand the role specifics in greater detail.

What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?

After the Bootcamp, I will spend 1-3 months focusing on mastering the technical interview. I want to be comfortable with that process before applying to any company. Within that same time frame, I will make a list of all the potential companies I want to work for and rank them from most interested to least interested. This way I can practice the technical interview with the companies I don't necessarily see myself at and gain the confidence as I work up from my list.

What do you plan to do to ensure you accomplish these goals?

In order to ensure I'm on the right path towards completing my goals, I have to make my goals visible. That means writing them down on paper, alerting me over phone notifications, and bringing them up over conversation. A constant reminder of my goals will channel my focus and not deter me from reaching them. I'm also looking forward to connecting with the University of Washington career counselors and establishing a scheduled cadence with them on career advancement opportunities.

How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

These plans certainly differ from the first half of the Bootcamp because in the earlier stages I was solely focused on establishing a rhythm with my coursework. I've now shifted my focus and energy towards carving out a career plan within the web development industry. After the Bootcamp, I will not stop learning and refining my skillset. I want to set myself up for success and one way to accomplish that is to not be stagnant.
